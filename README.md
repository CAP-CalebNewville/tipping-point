========================================

##Overview##
TippingPoint is a professional web-based aircraft weight and balance calculator with advanced graphing and safety validation. It features support for multiple aircraft, administrators, and comprehensive flight safety checks.

TippingPoint is ideal for flying clubs, flight schools, FBOs, and individual pilots. The administrator defines aircraft configurations through an intuitive web interface with support for multiple CG envelopes, configurable load types, and weight limits.

Pilots visit a modern, responsive interface to select their aircraft and input weights. The system provides real-time CG validation, weight limit checking, and safety warnings. Complete preflight weight and balance calculations can be finished in under a minute with professional-grade accuracy.

The current software version is 2.0.0 - a major overhaul with enhanced safety features. View the [changelog](https://github.com/CAP-CalebNewville/tipping-point/blob/main/changelog.txt) for release history.
