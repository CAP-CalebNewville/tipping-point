TippingPoint - Aircraft Weight &amp; Balance

## Overview
TippingPoint is a free, open source, web-based aircraft weight and balance calculator with graphing. It has support for multiple aircraft and administrators.

TippingPoint is ideal for flying clubs, flight schools, FBOs, corporate flight departments, charter services or even individuals. The administrator (owner/mechanic/operations officer/etc) defines the aircraft configuration using a simple web interface.

Pilots visit an equally intuitive web interface, choose their tail number, and plug in their weights. The entire preflight weight and balance can be completed in under a minute.

The current software version is 1.0.1 (released 20 Apr 2020). View the changelog for release history.
